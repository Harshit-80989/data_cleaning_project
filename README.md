# LinkedIn Job Postings Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world dataset of job postings collected from LinkedIn between 2023 and 2024. The dataset contains thousands of job listings with information such as job titles, company names, locations, salary ranges, application details, and required skills.

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values,
- Standardize and clean key columns like salary, location, and job title,
- Create clean and ready-to-use data for further analysis or visualization,
- Practice real-world data cleaning techniques using Python and Pandas.

This project is ideal for strengthening data wrangling skills and building a strong portfolio as a future data analyst or data scientist.
